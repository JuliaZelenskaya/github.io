    <h1>What is Color Psychology?</h1>
    <p id="maincontent">The psychology of color is based on the mental and emotional effects colors have on sighted people in all facets of life. There are some very subjective pieces to color psychology as well as some more accepted and proven elements. Keep in mind, that there will also be variations in interpretation, meaning, and perception between different cultures.</p>

        <h2>Warm Colours</h2>
        <p>Want to create an environment of stimulation or whet people’s appetite? You might consider utilizing the colors yellow or orange. These colors are often associated with food and can cause your tummy to growl a little. Have you ever wondered why so many restaurants use these colors? Now you know why even after people watched the movie SuperSize Me, they said they were hungry.</p>
        <p>You do want to be careful about using bright colors like orange and especially yellow. They reflect more light and excessively stimulate a person’s eyes which can lead to irritation. You also probably don’t want to paint your dining room or kitchen these colors if you’re a calorie-counter.</p>

        <h3><a id="red"></a>Red</h3>
        <p>Marketing colors like red can capture attention. The red color meaning is associated with excitement, passion, danger, energy, and action. You might’ve noticed that some brands use red for ‘order now’ buttons or for their packaging as a way to stand out on the shelf. In color psychology, red is the most intense color. And thus, can provoke the strongest emotions. Red can also trigger danger so you want to use the color sparingly. If you add the color red to your website, save it for the call to action or sale icons if it’ll contrast well with your store design.</p>
        <p>Red is the iconic color used for brands like Coca Cola and YouTube. The color red tends to encourage appetite hence why brands like Coca Cola use it often in their branding. They also use words like happiness in their branding so they use the color red to build excitement. YouTube likely uses the color red due to the excitement of watching videos online. Notice how the red part of their logo is the play button which can help compel someone into action. It encourages you to want to press play on their videos.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="colour content" style="border-color: orange;">
        <h3><a id="orange"></a>Orange</h3>
        <p>In color psychology, orange represents creativity, adventure, enthusiasm, success, and balance. The color orange adds a bit of fun to any picture, website, or marketing material it’s on. Despite it’s attracting color, it’s not as commanding as the color red. Many marketers still use the color for call to actions or areas of a website that they want to draw the eye too.</p>
        <p>Orange’s color meaning shines through in logos like Nickelodeon and The Home Depot. Nickelodeon is a children’s channel and so the logo accurately represents the creativity and enthusiasm that a children’s show would need through their playful orange color. The Home Depot sells products that you can use for your home. Many Do it Yourselfers (DIY) head to Home Depot to buy products to renovate their home or make adjustments. The orange logo here also represents creativity.</p>

        <h3><a id="yellow"></a>Yellow</h3>
        <p>In color psychology, the color meaning for yellow revolves around sunshine. It evokes feelings of happiness, positivity, optimism, and summer but also of deceit and warning. Some brands choose to use a cheerful yellow color as the background or border for their website design. You can also choose to use yellow for your ‘free shipping’ bar at the top of your website if it matches the rest of your website’s design. A little touch of yellow can help your website visitors associate your store with something positive.</p>
        <p>The color yellow is used by brands such as Ferrari and Ikea. Many people dream of driving a Ferrari. The luxury brand is associated with this feeling of happiness, summer and a carefree lifestyle. The Ikea brand also uses the color yellowing in their branding. What does buying furniture have to do with happiness? Well, let’s look at who’s likely buying those products. Many people who’ve just bought their first home or are moving out for the first time, will head to Ikea to buy products to furnish their home. This milestone is usually filled with happiness and optimism for the new change making yellow a great color to associate with the brand.</p>

        <p>Are you looking for a peaceful and calming environment? You might consider using green and/or blue. These cool colors are typically considered restful.

        <h3><a id="white"></a>White</h3>

        <h3><a id="grey"></a>Grey</h3>
        <p>In color psychology, grey represents neutrality and balance. Its color meaning likely comes from being the shade between white and black. However, grey does carry some negative connotations, particularly when it comes to depression and loss. Its absence of color makes it dull. Grey can be used for font color, headers, graphics, and even products to appeal to a mass audience.</p>
        <p>Apple is an example of a brand who uses the color grey in their branding. After all, many of their laptops are in a grey or silver-tone as its neutral color doesn’t put anyone off. On their website, they use the color grey for their header to contrast against a white logo. However, throughout their branding, you’ll see a balance between white, black and grey used which can help maintain a clean, neutral look.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="colour content"  style="border-color: brown; ">

        <p>Brown is an earthy color. After all, it’s the color of earth, wood and stone.

In marketing, you’ll find that brown is often used for natural products and food. Brown is a color that shows up in logos, banner images, and sometimes even text due to its contrast on a white background.</p>
        <p>UPS is an example of a brand who takes advantage of color meanings in their branding. On their website, the brown in their logo is emphasized in the navigation and drop down menus. You might also notice that complementary colors include yellow and green which all have natural elements to them. For example, yellow might represent the sun and green might represent nature.

        <h3><a id="beige"></a>Beige</h3>
        <p>Beige has traditionally been seen as a conservative, background color. In modern times, it has come to symbolize work, because so many office computers are beige.

Traditional Saudi Arabian dress includes a flowing floor-length outer cloak—a bisht—made of wool or camel hair in black, beige, brown or cream tones.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="colour content"  style="border-color: bisque; ">
        <h3><a id="bisque"></a>Bisque</h3>
        <p>Bisque is a type of orange color. In its meaning, orange is associated with energy, cheerfulness, activity, fire and warmth. Similar to yellow, orange takes the liveliness of it up a notch, while adding many aspects of red associated with warmth, as related to the color of flames. It also stimulates action rather than contemplation, promotion actions and events over thinking and contemplations. In contrast to yellow, lighter variations of orange do not produce a sense of relaxation, and can be seen by many as rather dull.</p>
        <p>It is still important to remember, however, that the meaning of orange color, and thus also Bisque, often depends on personal associations and preferences. It means that if used creatively, it can be employed for any marketing and branding purpose.</p>
